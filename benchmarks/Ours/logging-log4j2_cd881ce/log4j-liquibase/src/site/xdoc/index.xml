            <p>
                The Log4j 2 Liquibase Binding enables <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/">Liquibase</a> to log via Log4j 2.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section name="Requirements">
           <p>
             The Log4j 2 Liquibase Binding has a dependency
             on the Log4j 2 API as well as the Liquibase core.
          </p>
        </section>

      <section name="Usage">
        <p>
            Including this module will automatically make Liquibase log via Log4j 2, due the the plugin auto discovery mechanism of Liquibase.
        </p>
