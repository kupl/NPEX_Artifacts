    A Doxia module for Simplified DocBook documents. DocBook format is supported both as source and target formats.

    This module is not configured, by default, in the maven-site-plugin. To use this module in the 
    site plugin, you must explicitly configure it as a dependency in your pom.xml, as in the following example:

                 <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>3.0</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <chmod>true</chmod>
                        <inputEncoding>UTF-8</inputEncoding>
                        <outputEncoding>UTF-8</outputEncoding>
                    </configuration>
