    <section name="Doxia FO Module">

      <p>
        This is a <a href="http://maven.apache.org/doxia/">Doxia</a> module
        for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/">XSL Formatting Objects</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently only a sink is available, ie you can generate FO files
        either programmatically or by converting from any other
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/index.html">input format</a>
        supported by Doxia, but you cannot parse them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The generated FO files can then be converted into other formats,
        eg pdf, using <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">Apache Fop</a>.
        Check out the <a href="usage.html">usage</a> examples.
