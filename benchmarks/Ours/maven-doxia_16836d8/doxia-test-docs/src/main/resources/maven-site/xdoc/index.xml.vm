    <section name="Welcome to Maven">

      <!-- TODO: I reckon it's time for a new description -->
      <p>
        Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model
        (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you think that Maven could help your project, you can find out more information about in the "About Maven"
        section of the navigation. This includes an in-depth description of <a href="what-is-maven.html">what Maven is</a>,
        a <a href="maven-features.html">list of some of its main features</a>, and a set of <a href="general.html">frequently
        asked questions about what Maven is</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Learning about Maven</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: this could be the big button type thing instead of a list of links -->
        This site is separated into the following sections, depending on how you'd like to use Maven:
      </p>
      <!-- TODO: use CSS -->

      </ul>
      <p>
        Each guide is divided into a number of trails to get you started on a particular topic, and includes a
        reference area and a "cookbook" of common examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can access the guides at any time from the left navigation.
      </p>
      <h3>Documentation Index</h3>
      <p>
        If you are looking for a quick reference, you can use the <a href="guides/index.html">documentation index.</a>
<!-- TODO
        If you are looking for a quick reference, you can use the documentation index. It is available in both
        <a href="todo.html">alphabetical</a> and <a href="todo.html">categorical</a> listing formats.
-->
      </p>
      <h3>Plugins</h3>
<!-- TODO
      <p>
        Maven functionality is provided by plugins. For an explanation of how plugins work, and basic information on how
        to use a plugin, see the <a href="todo.html">introduction to plugins</a> in the Users Centre.
      </p>
-->
      <p>
        For detailed information on just some of the plugins available for Maven, see the
        <a href="plugins/index.html">plugin list</a>.
      </p>
<!-- TODO: Should these be here, or just in the user centre?
      <h3>Converting from a different Build System</h3>
      <p>
        If you are currently using a different build system, there are options for converting from that to Maven 2
        either partially or completely. These guides also give an overview of the differences between Maven and the
        other build system. The following guides are available in the Users Centre:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="todo.html">Converting from Ant to Maven 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="todo.html">Converting from Maven 1.x to Maven 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="todo.html">Adding Maven 2 to an IDE based build</a></li>
      </ul>
-->
      <h3>How to Get Support</h3>
      <p>
        Support for Maven is available in a variety of different forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started, search the documentation, the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER">wiki</a>,
        <a href="issue-tracking.html">issue tracker</a>, or the <a href="mail-lists.html">mailing list archives</a> to
        see if the problem has been solved or reported before.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the problem has not been reported before, the recommended way to get help is to
        subscribe to the <a href="mail-lists.html">Maven Users Mailing list</a>. Many other users and Maven developers
        will answer your questions there, and the answer will be archived for others in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also reach the Maven developers on <a href="community.html">IRC</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>How can I help?</h3>
      <p>
        Maven is an open source community and welcomes contributions. If you'd like to get involved, see the
        <a href="guides/development/guide-helping.html">Guide to helping with Maven</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maven is a part of the Apache Software Foundation. We'd like to <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html">thank
        the sponsors</a> that provide financial assistance to the foundation. For more information on how you can support the
        foundation, see the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html">sponsorship</a> page.
