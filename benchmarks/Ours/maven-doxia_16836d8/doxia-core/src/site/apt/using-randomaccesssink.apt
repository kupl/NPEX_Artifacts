Using the RandomAccessSink

  The RandomAccessSink is a Sink with the ability to add hooks. 
  To demonstrate its usage we can have a look at a FML (FAQ Markup Language)-page.
  The simple structure of such a page can be like:
  
+----------------+ 
  <faq id="1">
    <question/>
    <answer/>
  </faq>
  <faq id="2">
    <question/>
    <answer/>
  </faq>
+----------------+  

  Such structure would be parsed to the following page:
  
*-------------------------------+
| faq\["1"\].question \+ link   \
| faq\["2"\].question \+ link   \
*-------------------------------+
| faq\["1"\].question \+ anchor \
| faq\["1"\].answer             \
| faq\["2"\].question \+ anchor \
| faq\["2"\].answer             \
*-------------------------------+  

  With a Sink you can only append and there's no option to buffer.
  This would mean that you have to go twice over the structure: once for only the questions and once for the question + answer.
  
  When using the RandomAccesSink we can prepare the structure of the page
  
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
  RandomAccessSink randomAccessSink = new RandomAccessSink( sinkFactory, outputStream, encoding );
  Sink questions  = randomAccessSink.addSinkHook();
  Sink qAndA      = randomAccessSink.addSinkHook();
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*  

  Now you can append the first question to both sinks, and append the answer to the second one.
  The same can be done with the second faq-entry.
