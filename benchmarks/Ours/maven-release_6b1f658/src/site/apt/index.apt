Maven Release

 Maven Release provides tooling to release a project with Maven, saving a lot of repetitive, manual work.

 It consists of following modules:

*----------------------------------------------------------+----------------+
|| Module                                                  || Description   ||
*----------------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| {{{./maven-release-manager/}maven-release-manager}}      | core classes,
*----------------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| {{{/plugins/maven-release-plugin/}maven-release-plugin}} | release plugin to use from Maven.
*----------------------------------------------------------+----------------+

Notes for Developers

  There are tests in this project which require you to set the M2_HOME
  environment variable. Since many of the tests print error messages,
  it is easy to forget about this and then be puzzled.
