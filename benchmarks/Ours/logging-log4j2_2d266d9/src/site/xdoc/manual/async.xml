    <section name="Asynchronous Loggers for Low-Latency Logging">
      <p>
        Asynchronous logging can improve your application's performance by executing the I/O operations
        in a separate thread. Log4j 2 makes a number of improvements in this area.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Asynchronous Loggers</b> are a new addition in Log4j 2.
          Their aim is to return from the call to Logger.log to the application as
          soon as possible. You can choose between making all Loggers asynchronous
          or using a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous Loggers. Making all
          Loggers asynchronous will give the best performance, while mixing
          gives you more flexibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>LMAX Disruptor technology</b>. Asynchronous Loggers internally use the
          <a href="#UnderTheHood">Disruptor</a>, a lock-free inter-thread
          communication library, instead of queues, resulting in higher throughput and lower latency.
        </li>
        <li>
          As part of the work for Async Loggers, <b>Asynchronous Appenders</b> have
          been enhanced to flush to disk at the end of a batch (when the queue is empty).
          This produces the same result as configuring "immediateFlush=true", that is, all
          received log events are always available on disk, but is more efficient because it does not need to
          touch the disk on each and every log event. (Async Appenders use ArrayBlockingQueue internally and
          do not need the disruptor jar on the classpath.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <a name="Trade-offs" />
      <subsection name="Trade-offs">
        <p>
          Although asynchronous logging can give significant performance benefits,
          there are situations where you may want to choose synchronous logging.
          This section describes some of the trade-offs of asynchronous logging.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Benefits</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Higher peak <a href="#Performance">throughput</a>. With an asynchronous logger
            your application can log messages at 6 - 68 times the rate of a synchronous logger.</p>
            <p>This is especially interesting for applications that occasionally need to log
              bursts of messages. Async logging can help prevent or dampen latency spikes by shortening
              the wait time until the next message can be logged. If the queue size is configured
              large enough to handle the burst, asynchronous logging will help prevent your
              application from falling behind (as much) during a sudden increase of activity.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Lower logging response time <a href="#Latency">latency</a>.
            Response time latency is the time it takes for a call to Logger.log to return under a given workload.
            Asynchronous Loggers have consistently lower latency than synchronous loggers or even
            queue-based asynchronous appenders.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Drawbacks</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Error handling. If a problem happens during the logging process and an exception is thrown,
            it is less easy for an asynchronous logger or appender to signal this problem to the
            application. This can partly be alleviated by configuring an <tt>ExceptionHandler</tt>,
            but this may still not cover all cases. For this reason, if logging is part of your business logic,
            for example if you are using Log4j as an audit logging framework, we would
            recommend to synchronously log those audit messages.
            (Note that you can still <a href="#MixedSync-Async">combine</a> them
            and use asynchronous logging for debug/trace logging in addition to synchronous
            logging for the audit trail.)
          </li>
          <li>
            In some rare cases, care must be taken with mutable messages.
            Most of the time you don't need to worry about this. Log4 will ensure that log messages like
            <code>logger.debug("My object is {}", myObject)</code> will use the state of the
            <code>myObject</code> parameter at the time of the call to <code>logger.debug()</code>.
            The log message will not change even if <code>myObject</code> is modified later.
            It is safe to asynchronously log mutable objects because most
            <a href="../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/Message.html">Message</a>
            implementations built-in to Log4j take a snapshot of the parameters.
            There are some exceptions however:
            <a
              href="../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/MapMessage.html">MapMessage</a>
            and
            <a
              href="../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/StructuredDataMessage.html">StructuredDataMessage</a>
            are mutable by design: fields can be added to these messages after the message object was created.
            These messages should not be modified after they are logged with asynchronous loggers or
            asynchronous appenders; you may or may not see the modifications in the resulting log output.
            Similarly, custom
            <a
              href="../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/Message.html">Message</a>
            implementations should be designed with asynchronous use in mind, and either take a snapshot
            of their parameters at construction time, or document their thread-safety characteristics.
          </li>
          <li>If your application is running in an environment where CPU resources are scarce, like a machine
            with one CPU with a single core, starting another thread is not likely
            to give better performance.</li>
          <li>
            If the <em>sustained rate</em> at which your application is logging messages is faster than the
            maximum sustained throughput of the underlying appender, the queue will fill up and the
            application will end up logging at the speed of the slowest appender.
            If this happens, consider selecting a <a href="../performance.html#whichAppender">faster
            appender</a>, or logging less.
            If neither of these is an option, you may get better throughput and fewer latency spikes by
            logging synchronously.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <subsection name="Making All Loggers Asynchronous">
        <p>
          <i>Requires disruptor-3.0.0.jar or higher on the classpath.
            Future versions of Log4j 2 will require disruptor-3.3.3.jar or higher.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is simplest to configure and gives the best performance. To make all loggers asynchronous,
          add the disruptor jar to the classpath and set the system property <tt>Log4jContextSelector</tt>
          to <tt>org.apache.logging.log4j.core.async.AsyncLoggerContextSelector</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, <a href="#Location">location</a> is not passed to the I/O thread by
          asynchronous loggers. If one of your layouts or custom filters needs location information, you need to set
          "includeLocation=true" in the configuration of all relevant loggers, including the root logger.
        </p>
        <p>
          A configuration that does not require location might look like:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!-- Don't forget to set system property
-DLog4jContextSelector=org.apache.logging.log4j.core.async.AsyncLoggerContextSelector

        <p>
          When <tt>AsyncLoggerContextSelector</tt> is used to make all loggers asynchronous, make sure to use normal
          <tt>&lt;root&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;logger&gt;</tt> elements in the configuration. The
          AsyncLoggerContextSelector will ensure that all loggers are asynchronous, using a mechanism
          that is different from what happens when you configure <tt>&lt;asyncRoot&gt;</tt>
          or <tt>&lt;asyncLogger&gt;</tt>.
          The latter elements are intended for mixing async with sync loggers. If you use both mechanisms
          together you will end up with two background threads, where your application passes the log
          message to thread A, which passes the message to thread B, which then finally
          logs the message to disk. This works, but there will be an unnecessary step in the middle.

              <tt>Block</tt> is a strategy that uses a lock and condition variable for the I/O thread waiting for log events.
              Block can be used when throughput and low-latency are not as important as CPU resource.
              Recommended for resource constrained/virtualised environments.
              <br />
              <tt>Timeout</tt> is a variation of the <tt>Block</tt> strategy that will periodically
              wake up from the lock condition await() call. This ensures that if a notification is missed somehow
              the consumer thread is not stuck but will recover with a small latency delay (default 10ms).
              <br />
              <tt>Sleep</tt> is a strategy that initially spins, then uses a Thread.yield(), and
              eventually parks for the minimum number of nanos the OS and JVM will allow
              while the I/O thread is waiting for log events. Sleep is a good compromise between performance
              and CPU resource.
              This strategy has very low impact on the application thread, in exchange for some additional
              latency for actually getting the message logged.
              <br />
              <tt>Yield</tt> is a strategy that uses a Thread.yield() for waiting for log events after an initially spinning.
              Yield is a good compromise between performance and CPU resource, but may use more CPU than Sleep
              in order to get the message logged to disk sooner.

                This reduces logging latency a little, at the cost of some precision in the logged time stamps.
                Unless you are logging many events, you may see "jumps" of 10-16 milliseconds between log time stamps.
                WEB APPLICATION WARNING: The use of a background thread may cause issues
                for web applications and OSGi applications so CachedClock is not recommended for this kind

              <tt>Block</tt> is a strategy that uses a lock and condition variable for the I/O thread waiting for log events.
              Block can be used when throughput and low-latency are not as important as CPU resource.
              Recommended for resource constrained/virtualised environments.
              <br />
              <tt>Timeout</tt> is a variation of the <tt>Block</tt> strategy that will periodically
              wake up from the lock condition await() call. This ensures that if a notification is missed somehow
              the consumer thread is not stuck but will recover with a small latency delay (default 10ms).
              <br />
              <tt>Sleep</tt> is a strategy that initially spins, then uses a Thread.yield(), and
              eventually parks for the minimum number of nanos the OS and JVM will allow
              while the I/O thread is waiting for log events. Sleep is a good compromise between performance
              and CPU resource.
              This strategy has very low impact on the application thread, in exchange for some additional
              latency for actually getting the message logged.
              <br />
              <tt>Yield</tt> is a strategy that uses a Thread.yield() for waiting for log events after an initially spinning.
              Yield is a good compromise between performance and CPU resource, but may use more CPU than Sleep
              in order to get the message logged to disk sooner.

          There are also a few system properties that can be used to maintain application throughput even when
          the underlying appender cannot keep up with the logging rate and the queue is filling up.
          See the details for system properties
          <a href="configuration.html#log4j2.AsyncQueueFullPolicy"><tt>log4j2.AsyncQueueFullPolicy</tt> and

          If one of the layouts is configured with a location-related attribute like HTML
          <a href="layouts.html#HtmlLocationInfo">locationInfo</a>,
          or one of the patterns <a href="layouts.html#PatternClass">%C or $class</a>,

          Log4j will take a snapshot of the stack, and walk the stack trace to find the location information.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an expensive operation: 1.3 - 5 times slower for synchronous loggers. Synchronous loggers wait as
          long as possible before they take this stack snapshot. If no location is required, the snapshot will never be taken.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, asynchronous loggers need to make this decision before passing the
          log message to another thread; the location information will be lost after that point.
          The <a href="../performance.html#asyncLoggingWithLocation">performance impact</a> of taking a stack trace snapshot is even higher for asynchronous loggers:
          logging with location is 30-100 times slower than without location.
          For this reason, asynchronous loggers and asynchronous appenders do not include location information by default.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can override the default behaviour in your logger or asynchronous appender configuration
          by specifying <tt>includeLocation="true"</tt>.

          The throughput performance results below were derived from running the PerfTest, MTPerfTest and PerfTestDriver
          classes which can be found in the Log4j 2 unit test source directory.
          For throughput tests, the methodology used was:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>First, warm up the JVM by logging 200,000 log messages of 500 characters.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat the warm-up 10 times, then wait 10 seconds for the I/O thread to catch up and buffers to drain.</li>
          <li>Measure how long it takes to execute 256 * 1024 / threadCount calls to Logger.log
            and express the result in messages per second.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat the test 5 times and average the results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The results below were obtained with log4j-2.0-beta5, disruptor-3.0.0.beta3,
          log4j-1.2.17 and logback-1.0.10.
        </p>
        <h4>Logging Peak Throughput</h4>
        <p>
          The graph below compares the throughput of synchronous loggers, asynchronous appenders and asynchronous
          loggers. This is the total throughput of all threads together. In the test with 64 threads,
          asynchronous loggers are 12 times faster than asynchronous appenders, and 68 times faster than
          synchronous loggers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asynchronous loggers' throughput increases with the number of threads,
          whereas both synchronous loggers and asynchronous appenders
          have more or less constant throughput regardless of the number of
          threads that are doing the logging.

            alt="Async loggers have much higher throughput than sync loggers." />
        </p>

        <h4>Asynchronous Throughput Comparison with Other Logging Packages</h4>
        <p>
          We also compared peak throughput of asynchronous loggers to the synchronous loggers and asynchronous
          appenders available in other logging packages, specifically log4j-1.2.17 and
          logback-1.0.10, with similar results. For asynchronous appenders, total logging throughput of all
          threads together remains roughly constant when adding more threads.
          Asynchronous loggers make more effective use of the multiple cores
          available on the machine in multi-threaded scenarios.

        <table>
          <tr><td>This section has been rewritten with the Log4j 2.6 release.
            The previous version only reported <em>service time</em> instead of <em>response time</em>.
            See the <a href="../performance.html#responseTime">response time</a> side bar on the
            performance page on why this is too optimistic.
            Furthermore the previous version reported average latency, which does not make sense since
            latency is not a normal distribution.
            Finally, the previous version of this section only reported the maximum latency of up to 99.99%
            of the measurements, which does not tell you how bad the worst 0.01% were.
            This is unfortunate because often the "outliers" are all that matter when it comes to response time.
            From this release we will try to do better and report response time latency
            across the full range of percentages, including all the outliers.
            Our thanks to Gil Tene for his

        <p><a href="../performance.html#responseTime">Response time</a> is how long it takes to log a message under a certain load.
          What is often reported as latency is actually <em>service time</em>: how long it took to perform the operation.
          This hides the fact that a single spike in service time adds queueing delay for many of the subsequent operations.
          Service time is easy to measure (and often looks good on paper) but is irrelevant for users since it
          omits the time spent waiting for service.
          For this reason we report response time: service time plus wait time.

          The graph below compares response time latency of the
          ArrayBlockingQueue-based asynchronous appenders in Logback 1.1.7, Log4j 1.2.17 to the
          various options for asynchronous logging that Log4j 2.6 offers.
          Under a workload of 128,000 messages per second, using 16 threads (each logging at a rate of 8,000 messages
          per second), we see that Logback 1.1.7, Log4j 1.2.17 experience latency spikes that are orders
          of magnitude larger than Log4j 2.

        Performance Tuning"> <p>While the default settings should give good results
        out of the box, you may want to change settings to improve your logging throughput
        and/or latency. We suggest the following steps for tuning your logging performance:</p>
        <ol> <li>Create a base line by running the performance tests in your environment.</li>
        <li>Change a parameter (e.g. WaitStrategy or RingBufferSize) and run the
        tests again. Check performance results.</li> <li>Repeat (2) until you find
        a parameter combination that gives acceptable performance.</li> </ol> <p>Use
        the following command to run the performance tests:</p> <blockquote> <tt>java

          Asynchronous Loggers are implemented using the
          <a href="http://lmax-exchange.github.com/disruptor/">LMAX Disruptor</a>
          inter-thread messaging library. From the LMAX web site:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>... using queues to pass data between stages of the system was introducing latency, so we
            focused on optimising this area. The Disruptor is the result of our research and testing.
            We found that cache misses at the CPU-level, and locks requiring kernel arbitration are both
            extremely costly, so we created a framework which has "mechanical sympathy" for
            the hardware it's running on, and that's lock-free.
