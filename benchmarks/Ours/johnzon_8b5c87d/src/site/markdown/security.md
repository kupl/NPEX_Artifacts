# Reporting New Security Problems with Apache Johnzon

The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating security problems and denial of service attacks against Apache projects.

We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to the [private security mailing list](http://www.apache.org/security/) first, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Please note that the security mailing list should only be used for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities in Apache projects and managing the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. 
We cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries at this address. All mail sent to this address that does not relate to an undisclosed security problem will be ignored.

If you need to report a bug that isn't an undisclosed security vulnerability, please use the [bug reporting](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JOHNZON) system.

###Questions about:

* how to configure Johnzon securely
* if a vulnerability applies to your particular application
* obtaining further information on a published vulnerability
* availability of patches and/or new releases

should be addressed to the [mailing list](http://johnzon.apache.org/mail-lists.html).

The private security mailing address is: security (at) apache (dot) org
