h1. Description

This bundle uses the Jasypt tool to provide encryption support in the JAAS security framework.

Jasypt is a java library which allows the developer to add basic encryption capabilities to his/her projects
with minimum effort, and without the need of having deep knowledge on how cryptography works.

* High-security, standards-based encryption techniques, both for unidirectional and bidirectional encryption.
  Encrypt passwords, texts, numbers, binaries...
* Transparent integration with Hibernate.
* Suitable for integration into Spring-based applications and also transparently integrable with Spring Security.
* Integrated capabilities for encrypting the configuration of applications (i.e. datasources).
* Specific features for high-performance encryption in multi-processor/multi-core systems.
* Open API for use with any JCE provider.
