This directory contains sample FO files for testing the accessibility features
of FOP.

Every FO file in this directory has a corresponding PDF file in the pdf/
sub-directory. The fop.xconf configuration file was used.

The PDF files have been checked with Adobe Acrobat Professional 9, using both 
the full accessibility checker and the read-aloud feature. The checker reports 
no error /and/ the entire document can be read aloud.


!! DO NOT MODIFY THOSE FILES, NEITHER THE FO NOR THE PDF !!


... Or at least, know what you are doing
If the FO files are modified, the resulting PDFs must be checked again, both 
with the checker and the read-aloud feature. (Sometimes the checker reports no 
problem yet part or all of the document cannot be read aloud.)

The purpose of this infrastructure is to be able to quickly re-test the 
accessibility processing chain when any change has been made to it. The 
configuration file disables the compression of the PDF streams, so it is 
possible to compare a re-generated PDF with the original one by using a simple 
diff tool. The files will not be identical because of the different creation 
dates (and the ID key in the trailer), but apart from that there should be no 
difference.

The rationale is that using a diff tool is much quicker and less tedious than 
running Acrobat's accessibility checker and read-aloud feature every time.


To re-generate the PDF files:
    ../../fop -c fop.xconf text_1.fo pdf/text_1.new.pdf
    diff pdf/text_1_painter.pdf pdf/text_1.new.pdf
Or, going through the intermediate format:
    ../../fop -c fop.xconf text_1.fo -if application/pdf text_1_if.xml
    ../../fop -c fop.xconf -ifin text_1_if.xml pdf/text_1.new.pdf
    diff pdf/text_1.pdf pdf/text_1.new.pdf
