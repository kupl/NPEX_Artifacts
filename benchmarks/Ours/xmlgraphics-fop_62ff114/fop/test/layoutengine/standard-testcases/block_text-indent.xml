In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters 
were all beautiful; and the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which 
has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the king's 
castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, 
and when the day was very warm, the king's child went out into the forest and sat 
down by the side of the cool fountain; and when she was bored she took a golden ball, 
and threw it up on high and caught it; and this ball was her favorite plaything.
