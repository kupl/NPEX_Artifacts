  <info>
    <p>
      This test checks for the handling of explicit breaking characters:
      - preserved linefeeds (U+000A)
      - Unicode next-line (U+0085), line-separator (U+2028) 
        or paragraph-separator (U+2029)
      Other possibilities defined in UAX#14, but not applicable for XSL-FO:
      - carriage return (U+000D) is normalized to a space
      - line-tabulation (U+000B) and form-feed (U+000C) are illegal XML characters
