/**
 * The document is the highest level of the MO:DCA data-stream document
 * component hierarchy. Documents can be made up of pages, and the pages, which
 * are at the intermediate level, can be made up of objects. Objects are at the
 * lowest level, and can be bar codes, graphics, images, and presentation text.
 *
 * At each level of the hierarchy certain sets of MO:DCA data structures, called
 * structured fields, are permissible. The document, pages and objects are
 * bounded by structured fields that define their beginnings and their ends.
 * These structured fields, called begin-end pairs, provide an envelope for the
 * data-stream components. This feature enables a processor of the data stream
 * that is not fully compliant with the architecture to bypass those objects
 * that are beyond its scope, and to process the data stream to the best of its
 * abilities.
 *
 * A presentation document is one that has been formatted and is intended for
 * presentation, usually on a printer or display device. A data stream
 * containing a presentation document should produce the same document content
 * in the same format on different printers or display devices dependent,
 * however, on the capabilities of each of the printers or display devices. A
 * presentation document can reference resources that are to be included as part
 * of the document to be presented.
