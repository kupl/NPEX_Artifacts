/**
 * <p>This class enables to transcode an input to a EPS document.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two transcoding hints (<code>KEY_WIDTH</code> and
 * <code>KEY_HEIGHT</code>) can be used to respectively specify the image
 * width and the image height. If only one of these keys is specified,
 * the transcoder preserves the aspect ratio of the original image.
 *
 * <p>The <code>KEY_BACKGROUND_COLOR</code> defines the background color
 * to use for opaque image formats, or the background color that may
 * be used for image formats that support alpha channel.
 *
 * <p>The <code>KEY_AOI</code> represents the area of interest to paint
 * in device space.
 *
 * <p>Three additional transcoding hints that act on the SVG
 * processor can be specified:
 *
 * <p><code>KEY_LANGUAGE</code> to set the default language to use (may be
 * used by a &lt;switch&gt; SVG element for example),
 * <code>KEY_USER_STYLESHEET_URI</code> to fix the URI of a user
 * stylesheet, and <code>KEY_PIXEL_TO_MM</code> to specify the pixel to
 * millimeter conversion factor.
