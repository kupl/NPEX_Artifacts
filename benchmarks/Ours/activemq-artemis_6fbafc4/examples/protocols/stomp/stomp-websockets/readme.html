     <h1>Stomp WebSockets Example</h1>

     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>

     <p>This example shows you how to configure ActiveMQ Artemis to send and receive Stomp messages from modern web browser using Web Sockets.</p>

     <p>The example will start a ActiveMQ Artemis server configured with Stomp over Web Sockets and JMS. Web browsers clients and
       Java application will exchange message using a JMS Topic.</p></para>

&lt;acceptor name="stomp-websocket">tcp://localhost:61614&lt;/acceptor></pre>

     <h2>Example step-by-step</h2>

     <p><i>To run the example, simply type <code>mvn verify -Pexample</code> from this directory</i></p>

    <p>To subscribe to the topic from your web browser, open the <a href="chat/index.html">Chat Example</a> or the <a href="aerogear-chat/aerogear-index.html">JBoss AeroGear STOMP notifier Chat Example</a> from another tab.
      The chat example is preconfigured to connect to the ActiveMQ Artemis server with the URL <code>ws://localhost:61613</code> and subscribe to the JMS Topic (through its core address
      <code>jms.topic.chat</code>).
    </p>
    <p>You can open as many Web clients as you want and they will all exchange messages through the topic</p>
    <p>If you run again the Java application (with <code>./build.sh</code>), the web clients will also receive its message</p>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>A JavaScript library is used on the browser side to be able to use Stomp Over Web Sockets (please see its <a href="http://jmesnil.net/stomp-websocket/doc/">documentation</a>
      for a complete description).</p>
    <p>The <a href="aerogear-chat/aerogear-index.html">JBoss AeroGear STOMP notifier Chat Example</a> is using the AeroGear Notifier which is a collection of adapters that provide a unified or similar API for interacting with different messaging services and protocols. The STOMP adapter is used for communicating with STOMP over WebSockets. See more at: <a href="http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-js/">JBoss aerogear-js</a> </p>
