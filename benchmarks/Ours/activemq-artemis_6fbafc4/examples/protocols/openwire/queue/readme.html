     <h1>JMS Queue Example for open wire</h1>

     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>


     <p>This example shows you how to send and receive a message to a JMS Queue using ActiveMQ Artemis.</p>
     <p>This example does exactly the same as the <a href="../../../broker-features/standard/queue/readme.html">queue example under broker-features/standard</a>, however using the openwire client.</p>
     <p>Queues are a standard part of JMS, please consult the JMS 1.1 specification for full details.</p>
     <p>A Queue is used to send messages point to point, from a producer to a consumer. The queue guarantees message ordering between these 2 points.</p>
     <p>Notice this example is using pretty much a default stock configuration</p>
