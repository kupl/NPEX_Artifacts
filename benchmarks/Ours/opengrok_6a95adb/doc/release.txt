Release criteria
----------------

Ideally, the following minimum criteria should be fulfilled before a new version
is released:

  - The code coverage for blocks must be at least 80%
  - No findbugs warnings
  - No stoppers
  - All bugs and enhancements must be evaluated


Checklist for releasing OpenGrok:
---------------------------------

../ext_lib - is a directory where we keep latest JFlex.jar and all necessary
jars/dirs for tests

0) set proper version in build.xml

   <property name="version" value="???"/>

   and put some stuff into CHANGES.txt

   Then commit and push the change:

     git commit build.xml
     git push

1) build must be clean

   ant clean
   ant # defaults to jar currently

2) sanity check:

   - index
   - deploy webapp
   - check serarch

3) check all tests, tests code coverage:
   junit, pmd, findbugs, checkstyle, emma, jdepend

They should be ok, currently only checkstyle has 8 warnings, the rest is
clean; emma reports should be based according to what is set for the release,
usually it's overall coverage above 80%)

(jenkins can help here, see README.txt on setup)

The release is OK, once above is fulfilled to our satisfaction.

4) produce proper distributions

Check them before upload, always try to build on Solaris, since GNU tar might
create a non-standard compliant .tgz version and tag from step 0) will be used
to produce the archive

  ant dist
  ant package

The command above creates both formats of package .pkg and .p5p into the directory dist


Note that for the IPS package *.p5p the version names are translated this way:

0.12          ~       0.12.0.1.0
0.<n>         ~       0.<n>.0.1.0
...

0.12-rc1      ~       0.12.0.0.1
0.12-rc<i>    ~       0.12.0.0.<i>
...

(Note that the release candidate must follow immediately after the basic version
number (0.12))


0.12.1        ~       0.12.1.0.0
0.12.<j>      ~       0.12.<j>.0.0
...

0.12.0.1      ~       0.12.0.1.1
0.12.0.<k>    ~       0.12.0.1.<k>
...

5) Create the release and upload the files via GitHub API:

   First, make sure these environment variables are set:

      GITHUB_USER (your Github user name)
      GITHUB_PASSWORD (your Github password)
      https_proxy (set to host:port of proxy if behind HTTP proxy)
      DO_PRERELEASE (set to non-empty if creating release candidate)

   Next:

      ant release

   Now go to https://github.com/OpenGrok/OpenGrok/releases and edit the text
   of the release, e.g. adding list of issues fixed, whether complete reindex
   is necessary etc.

5) Send announcement to opengrok-users@yahoogroups.com
