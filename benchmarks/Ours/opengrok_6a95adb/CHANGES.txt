release candidate and the release.

* New jQuery (1.4.2) underneath - UI improvements
* Support for xrefs with Unicode characters (not indexed yet, but
  finally viewable)

  of by the service (Solaris/OpenSolaris only)

We'd like to thank all the people who report bugs, send us ideas and
improvements. Below are just people that sent patches or pushed code.
That doesn't mean that we don't appreciate your work. On the contrary,
you are the people showing other people (who have the time to write
code) what would be good to fix when you use this software and file
bugs against it!  Note that this is just a summary of how many changes
each person made, which doesn't necessarily reflect how significant
each change was. (Inspect the history log with "hg log -v -r 0.8.1:0.9"
to get all details.)

October 2008 update 0.7
-------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES

* Support more source code repository backends:
   o ClearCase (Magnus Lind)
   o Git (Jorgen Austvik)
   o Razor (Peter Bray)

* JMX Agent (Jan Stale Berg)

OpenGrok can now talk JMX with clients. This work is the start of a 
project to make it easier to configure OpenGrok. The first proof of 
concept is a system tray applet to show OpenGrok status.

* Use external Subversion binary instead of svn-javahl.jar (Trond)

A lot of our users had problems installing svn-javahl.jar, now we use 
the system provided svn binary.

* Logging

OpenGrok is changed to use standard java.util.logging (Jan Stale Berg, 
Trond, Lubos Kosco)

* Store history cache in compressed files to save disk space (Trond)

* Quality (Trond, Knut Anders, Lubos Kosco, Jorgen Austvik)
   - We have incorporated tools like PMD, FindBugs, CheckStyle and 
Hudson into our development process, and fixed lots and lots of 
potential bugs long before any users experience them.
   - We have started to write unit-tests, and use Emma to measure how 
good they are. In this release our unit tests cover 61% of our code 
(block coverage), for OpenGrok 0.8 we aim for 70%.

* General code and design cleanup (Peter Bray, Trond, Knut Anders, Lubos 
Kosco, Jorgen Austvik)
