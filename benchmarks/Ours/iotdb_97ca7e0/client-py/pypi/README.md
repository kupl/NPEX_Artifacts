Apache IoTDB (incubating) (Database for Internet of Things) is an integrated data management engine designed for
timeseries data. It provides users with services for data collection, storage and analysis. Due to its light-weight
architecture, high performance and rich feature set together with its deep integration with Apache Hadoop and Spark,
Apache IoTDB (incubating) can meet the requirements of massive data storage, high-speed data ingestion and complex data
analysis in the IoT industrial fields.


# Apache IoTDB Python Client API

Using the package, you can write data to IoTDB, read data from IoTDB and maintain the schema of IoTDB.

## Requirements

You have to install thrift (>=0.13) before using the package.

## How to use (Example)

First, download the package: `pip3 install apache-iotdb`

You can get an example of using the package to read and write data at here: [Example](https://github.com/apache/iotdb/blob/rel/0.10/client-py/src/SessionExample.py)

(you need to add `import iotdb` in the head of the file)

# DISCLAIMER

Apache IoTDB is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF).
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent
with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.
