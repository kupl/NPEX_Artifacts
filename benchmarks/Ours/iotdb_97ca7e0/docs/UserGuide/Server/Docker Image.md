# Docker Image

Now a Dockerfile has been written at docker/src/main/Dockerfile.

1. You can build a docker image by: 
```
$ docker build -t iotdb:base git://github.com/apache/iotdb#master:docker
```
Or:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/iotdb
$ cd iotdb
$ cd docker
$ docker build -t iotdb:base .
```
Once the docker image has been built locally (the tag is iotdb:base in this example), you are almost done!

2. create docker volume for data files and logs:
```
$ docker volume create mydata
$ docker volume create mylogs
```
3. run a docker container:
```shell
$ docker run -p 6667:6667 -v mydata:/iotdb/data -v mylogs:/iotdb/logs -d iotdb:base /iotdb/bin/start-server.sh
```
If success, you can run `docker ps`, and get something like the following:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                               NAMES
2a68b6944cb5        iotdb:base          "/iotdb/bin/start-seâ€¦"   4 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        0.0.0.0:6667->6667/tcp              laughing_meitner
```
You can use the above command to get the container ID: 
```
$ docker container ls
```
suppose the ID is <C_ID>.

And get the docker IP by:
```
$ docker inspect --format='{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' <C_ID>
```
suppose the IP is <C_IP>.

4. If you just want to have a try by using iotdb-cli, you can:
```
$ docker exec -it /bin/bash  <C_ID>
$ (now you have enter the container): /cli/sbin/start-cli.sh -h localhost -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```

Or,  run a new docker container as the client:
```
$ docker run -it iotdb:base /cli/sbin/start-cli.sh -h <C_IP> -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```
Or,  if you have a iotdb-cli locally (e.g., you have compiled the source code by `mvn package`), and suppose your work_dir is cli/bin, then you can just run:
```
$ start-cli.sh -h localhost -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```
5. If you want to write codes to insert data and query data, please add the following dependence:
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.iotdb</groupId>
            <artifactId>iotdb-jdbc</artifactId>
            <version>0.10.0</version>
        </dependency>
```
Some examples about how to use IoTDB with IoTDB-JDBC can be found at: https://github.com/apache/iotdb/tree/master/example/jdbc/src/main/java/org/apache/iotdb

6. Now enjoy it!
