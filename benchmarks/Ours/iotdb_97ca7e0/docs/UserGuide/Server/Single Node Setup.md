# Single Node Setup

Users are able to start IoTDB through the start-server script under the sbin folder.

```
# Unix/OS X
> nohup sbin/start-server.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 &
or
> nohup sbin/start-server.sh -c <conf_path> -rpc_port <rpc_port> >/dev/null 2>&1 &

# Windows
> sbin\start-server.bat -c <conf_path> -rpc_port <rpc_port>
```
- "-c" and "-rpc_port" are optional.
- option "-c" specifies the system configuration file directory.
- option "-rpc_port" specifies the rpc port.
- if both option specified, the *rpc_port* will override the rpc_port in *conf_path*.
