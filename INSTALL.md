## Using a Docker Image
We have published our artifact on figshare [(link)](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19087652.v1).

Firstly, please run the following command to download the docker image (`npex-artifacts.tar`) from shell:
```
$ wget https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/33920795
```
Now load the image from the artifact tar:
```
$ docker load -i npex-artifacts.tar
```
Please check the following image id is printed on the shell: `Loaded image ID: sha256:574c743ea07b...`

Finally, run the following command to run a docker container from the image.
```
$ docker run -it 574c743ea07b
```

That's all! You are ready to use our artifact.

## Building NPEX from Source Codes
The NPEX source codes are avilable on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/kupl/npex.

If you want to build NPEX from source codes, first clone the source codes:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kupl/NPEX --recursive
```
For further instructions, please see the repository!

# Getting Started
We explain how use NPEX to fix a given NPE.
Let's consider fixing NPE in [aries-jpa_7712046](benchmarks/Ours/aries-jpa_7712046).
If you type ```mvn test``` at the project, the test will fail with NPE.
To fix this NPE, we need to first prepare inputs of NPEX.

## Step 1. Preparing Inputs
NPEX takes the following three inputs:
* npe.json: Information of the given NPE.
  * filepath, line, npe_class, npe_method of the given NPE
  * deref_field: last field name of null pointer (e.g., "x" for x, "f" for x.f())
* traces.json: NPE Stack trace.
* Buggy program builded by Infer and Spoon.

For example, NPEX takes the following two inputs for aries-jpa_7712046.
```
npe.json = {
    "filepath": "jpa-blueprint/src/main/java/org/apache/aries/jpa/blueprint/impl/AnnotationScanner.java",
    "line": 39,
    "npe_class": "AnnotationScanner",
    "npe_method": "parseClass",
    "deref_field": "cl",
}
```
```
traces.json =
[
    {
        "filepath": "jpa-blueprint/src/main/java/org/apache/aries/jpa/blueprint/impl/AnnotationScanner.java",
        "line": 39,
        "method_name": "parseClass"
    },
    {
        "filepath": "jpa-blueprint/src/main/java/org/apache/aries/jpa/blueprint/impl/AnnotationScanner.java",
        "line": 33,
        "method_name": "getJpaAnnotatedMembers"
    },
    {
        "filepath": "jpa-blueprint/src/test/java/org/apache/aries/jpa/blueprint/impl/AnnotationScannerTest.java",
        "line": 96,
        "method_name": "getFactoryTest"
    }
]
```
For npe.json, we need to manually write the information of NPE. For traces.json, we provide a script for parsing the 
stack trace of NPE. For example, we can get ```traces.json``` by the following stack trace and the command.
```
stack_trace.txt = 
	java.lang.NullPointerException: null
        at org.apache.aries.jpa.blueprint.impl.AnnotationScanner.parseClass(AnnotationScanner.java:39)
        at org.apache.aries.jpa.blueprint.impl.AnnotationScanner.getJpaAnnotatedMembers(AnnotationScanner.java:33)
        at org.apache.aries.jpa.blueprint.impl.AnnotationScannerTest.getFactoryTest(AnnotationScannerTest.java:96)
```
``` npex prepare --parse_trace stack_trace.txt```

Then, we also need to build the buggy program with Infer and Spoon.
```
npex prepare --build
```
Currently, we only support a java program with Maven2 build system.

## Step 2. Fault Localization
Then we perform fault localization by the given ```npe.json``` and the stack trace ```traces.json```.
```
npex run --localize
```
Then, localized NPEs (JSON file with prefix `npe_`) will be generated. 
For the example, the following JSONs are generated:
```
npe_AnnotationScanner.java_30.json
npe_AnnotationScanner.java_32.json 
npe_AnnotationScanner.java_33.json 
npe_AnnotationScanner.java_38.json 
npe_AnnotationScanner.java_39.json
```

## Step 3. Patch Enumeration
Then, we enumerate patches for all the localized NPEs. The following command will takes all `npe*.json` and enumerate patches.
```
npex run --enumerate
```
The generated patches are located at ```patches``` directory.


## Step 4. Instantiate Null Handling Model
To infer a specification, we need a null handling model which is a map from NPE expression to alternative expression. 
```
npex run --predict
```
Then, a null handling model is generated at ```model.json```.
This procedure uses a learned classifier to instantiate a null handling model for a given program.
The learned classifier is located at ```tools/npex/example/classifier-example```

## Step 5. Specification Inference & Patch Validation
The last step of NPEX is to infer a specification and validate patches by the inferred specification.
```
npex run --validate
```
Then the validation result is stored at ```result.json```.
In this example, the results is
```
{
    "number_of_patches": 27,
    "time_to_verify": 172.13991022109985,
    "time_to_inference": 0.6845083236694336,
    "time_to_capture_original": 0.0,
    "time_to_capture_patches": 162.69369459152222,
    "verified_patches": [
        "SkipBreakStrategy_33-32_1"
    ],
    "rejected_patches": [
        "ReplacePointerStrategy_32_0",
        ...
    ]
}
```
